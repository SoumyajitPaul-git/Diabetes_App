The data from the R package lars. SAS code to access these data. Proc Means and Proc Print Output when using the above data from R. Note that the 10 x variables have been standardized to have mean 0 and squared length = 1 (sum(x^2)=1).

SAS Data set of Hastie's "quadratic model" data64.txt with Y added at the end.

Brief Description
From Bradley Efron, Trevor Hastie, Iain Johnstone and Robert Tibshirani (2004) "Least Angle Regression," Annals of Statistics (with discussion), 407-499, we have

"Ten baseline variables, age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements were obtained for each of n = 442 diabetes patients, as well as the response of interest, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline."

In the tab delimited file above, the variables are named

AGE SEX BMI BP S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 Y
whereas, in the R file, they are named
age sex bmi map tc ldl hdl tch ltg glu y
In the SAS data set with quadratic variables added, the variables are
age sex bmi  map  tc  ldl  hdl  tch  ltg  glu
age2    bmi2 map2 tc2 ldl2 hdl2 tch2 ltg2 glu2
